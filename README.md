# ðŸ’Ž Shiny stones mobile

Taking my original [shiny-stones](https://github.com/pepf/shiny-stones) for web as starting point, I've ported the game to react-native.

Like the original, it uses three.js and react-three-fiber under the hood. This allows me to render the gameplay elements in a declarative way.

## Todo
- Figure out smooth animations in react-native. I suspect react-spring might not work.
- Scoring
- More gameplay elements
- Graphical improvements, better colors, materials and lightning, leveraging the fact that it works with openGL.
